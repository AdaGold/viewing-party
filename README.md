## Goal

You and your friends enjoy watching things together online. Of course, everyone has seen different things, has different favorites, and different things they want to watch.

You've been using a spreadsheet to compare everyone's watched list, favorites list, and watchlist, but it's been getting too cumbersome. In order to find things you've watched and your friends haven't watched, or things that your friends have watched and you haven't watched, you have to comb through the spreadsheet. You know that there are different ways we can get that information: we can use Python!

For this project, you will be given some data structure that represents the things you've watched, favorited, and want to watch. The directions below will lead you to create a series of functions. These functions will modify the data, and implement features like adding and removing things between different lists. Other features include creating recommendations!

## One-Time Project Setup

Follow these directions once, a the beginning of your project:

1. Navigate to your projects folder named `projects`

```bash
$ cd ~/Developer/projects
```

2. "Clone" (download a copy of this project) into your projects folder. This command makes a new folder called `viewing-party`, and then puts the project into this new folder.

```bash
$ git clone ...
```

Use `ls` to confirm there's a new project folder

3. Move your location into this project folder

```bash
$ cd viewing-party
```

4. Create a virtual environment named `venv` for this project:

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

5. Activate this environment:

```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Verify that you're in a python3 virtual environment by running:

- `$ python --version` should output a Python 3 version
- `$ pip --version` should output that it is working with Python 3

6. Install dependencies once at the beginning of this project with

```bash
# Must be in activated virtual environment
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Summary of one-time project setup:

- [ ] `cd` into your `projects` folder
- [ ] Clone the project onto your machine
- [ ] `cd` into the `viewing-party` folder
- [ ] Create the virtual environment `venv`
- [ ] Activate the virtual environment `venv`
- [ ] Install the dependences with `pip`

## Project Development Workflow

We will use a Test Driven Development programming workflow to work on this project. Notice the Red-Green-Refactor steps in the workflow steps outlined below.

1. When you want to begin work on this project, ensure that your virtual environment is activated:

```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Find the test file that contains the test you want to run. Ensure that the test(s) you want to run isn't skipped.

   - Check the `tests` folder, and find the test file you want to run
   - In that test file, read through each test case
   - Remove all lines that contain `@pytest.mark.skip()`

3. For each test, check if the test is complete or not. 

  - If it is incomplete, write the test. 
    - Is this a nominal or edge case?
    - What type of input do we need to test this case?
    - What is the expected output for the given input?

  - If it is complete, read the test critically.
    - How does this test map on to the requirement described in the project instructions?
    - What is the expected output for the given input?

4. Run the test(s)! (RED)

```bash
# Must be in activated virtual environment in the project-root directory
$ pytest
```

5. Focus on the top test failure. Read through the test failure, and understand why the failure is happening. Confirm your findings with a classmate. 
  - If it is a test you wrote, consider whether you are actually testing what you intend to test. Does this test need modification?

6. Make a plan to implement code to pass the test.

7. Write code in `party.py` to pass the test.

8. Re-run the tests.

9. Repeat steps 4-8 until that test passes! (GREEN)

10. Repeats steps 3-9 until you have finished all tests in the file.

11. Begin using the test file of the next wave!

12. Look for opportunities to improve your code (REFACTOR)

13. When you are finished working for the day, deactivate your environment with deactivate or closing the Terminal tab/window

```bash
$ deactivate
```

Finally, at submission time, **no matter where you are**, submit the project via Learn.

## Details About How to Run Tests

All the commands described below should be run from the project-root directory `viewing-party`. Note that the project-root directory is the repository `viewing-party`. It is distinct from the directory `viewing_party` that contains the source code in `party.py`.

To run all unskipped tests that exist in this project with:

```bash
# Must be in activated virtual environment
$ pytest
```

To see any `print` statements print to the console, add `-s` to the end of any `pytest` command:

```bash
# Must be in activated virtual environment
$ pytest -s
```

To run all unskipped tests that exist in one file, use:

```bash
# Must be in activated virtual environment
$ pytest tests/test_file_name.py
```

... where `test_file_name.py` is relpaced with the correct test file name.

To run a single test by name:

```bash
# Must be in activated virtual environment
$ pytest tests/test_file_name.py::test_name
```

... where `test_name.py` is relpaced with the name of the function.

## Play Testing

While we will mainly use a Test Driven Development (TDD) workflow for this project, it can be helpful to run code independently from running tests. To do this, a file `play_tester.py` is provided.

To run this file, use:

```bash
python3 play_tester.py
```

There is some starter code provided in `play_tester.py`. This code prints the test data that is used for many of the tests. Looking closely at this data can help us think critically about the expected output for given input for each function. Then, calling each function with this data allows us to observe the **actual** output for given input. 

## Test Data

We will note that much of the test data for this project is provided by the file `test_constants.py`. As test data gets more and more complex, it is helpful to organize this data in its own file to enhance consistency and readability. Pytest, like many testing libraries, provide a special too for test data called **fixtures**. We will learn about fixtures later in the curriculum. 

For the time being, we need to make sure that the data provided to each test is clean and free of any changes that running another test may have introduced. Recall modifying mutable objects section of the [Variables Are References](https://learn-2.galvanize.com/cohorts/2330/blocks/1829/content_files/variables-and-memory/variables-are-references.md#modifying-mutable-objects) lesson. To ensure that the data for each test is storied in a unique place in memory, there are functions implemented in `test_constants.py` that provide clean test data (i.e. `clean_wave_3_data`) by using `copy.deepcopy`. 

## Project Directions

This project is designed such that one could puzzle together how to implement this project without many directions. Being able to read tests to understand what is expected of our program is a skill that needs to be developed; programmers often take years to develop this skill competently.

When our test failures leave us confused and stuck, let's use the detailed project requirements below.

### Wave 1

1. The first four tests are about a `create_movie()` function.

In `party.py`, there should be a function named `create_movie`. This function should...

- take three parameters: `title`, `genre`, `rating`
- If those three attributes are truthy, then return a dictionary. This dictionary should...
  - Have three key-value pairs, with specific keys
  - The three keys should be `"title"`, `"genre"`, and `"rating"`
  - The values of these key-value pairs should be appropriate values
- If `title` is falsy, `genre` is falsy, or `rating` is falsy, this function should return `None`

2. The next two tests are about an `add_to_watched()` function.

In `party.py`, there should be a function named `add_to_watched`. This function should...

- take two parameters: `user_data`, `movie`
  - the value of `user_data` will be a dictionary with a key `"watched"`, and a value which is a list of dictionaries representing the movies the user has watched
    - An empty list represents that the user has no movies in their watched list
  - the value of `movie` will be a dictionary in this format:
    - ```python
      {
        "title": "Title A",
        "genre": "Horror",
        "rating": 3.5
      }
      ```
